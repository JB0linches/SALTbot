 # Wikidata to Wikibase importer

This repository consists of two files:

* `Importing_entities.ipynb` notebook with documentation and possible implementations of different ways to import entities from Wikidata
* `importer2.py` a functional implementation of an importer 

**We recommend you go through `importer2.py` and edit these lines according to the wikibase you want to target**

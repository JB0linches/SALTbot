{"description": [{"excerpt": "**RAWGraphs** is an open web tool to create custom vector-based visualizations on top of the amazing [d3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) library.\nIt has been developed by [DensityDesign Research Lab](http://www.densitydesign.org/) ([Politecnico di Milano](http://www.polimi.it/)), [Calibro](http://calib.ro/) and [INMAGIK](https://inmagik.com/). \nPrimarily conceived as a tool for designers and vis geeks, RAWGraphs aims at providing a missing link between spreadsheet applications (e.g., LibreOffice Calc, Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers, Google Docs) and vector graphics editors (e.g., Inkscape, Adobe Illustrator). \nRAWGraphs works with [tabular data](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(information)>) (e.g., spreadsheets and comma-separated values) as well as with copied-and-pasted texts from other applications. Based on the [SVG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svg) format, visualizations can be easily edited with vector graphics applications for further refinements or directly embedded into web pages. \nKnowing the need to work with sensitive information, the data injected into RAWGraphs is processed only by the web browser: **no server-side operations or storages are performed**. No one will see, touch or copy your data! \nRAWGraphs is also highly customizable and extensible, accepting new custom layouts defined by users. For more information about adding or editing layouts, see the [Developer Guide](https://github.com/rawgraphs/raw/wiki/Developer-Guide). \n", "confidence": [[0.8511653216745175, 0.8642576371564927, 0.956003962779361, 0.9782432487103759, 0.9689414675425567]], "technique": "Supervised classification", "originalHeader": "About"}, {"excerpt": "A web interface to create custom vector-based visualizations on top of RAWGraphs core", "confidence": [1.0], "technique": "GitHub API"}], "citation": [{"originalHeader": "Publications / Citing RAWGraphs", "excerpt": "If you have found RAWGraphs helpful in your research, or if you want to reference it in your work, please consider citing the paper we presented at [CHItaly 2017](http://sites.unica.it/chitaly2017/).\n\nyou can read the full article in Green Open Access at the following link:\n\n![oa icon](http://dl.acm.org/images/oa.gif) [RAWGraphs: A Visualisation Platform to Create Open Outputs](http://rawgraphs.io/about/#cite)\n\nCite RAWGraphs:\n\n> Mauri, M., Elli, T., Caviglia, G., Uboldi, G., & Azzi, M.

You are more than welcome! Start by cloning the repository (the \"Code\" button at the top-right corner of this page) and follow the instructions in README file to install dependencies and set it up.\nThen you can use Github's issues and pull requests to discuss and share your work.\nYou will need to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before making a submission. It will be automatically prompted in the moment you will make a \"pull request\" to the repository. We adopted CLA to be sure that the project will remain open source.\nFor more information, write us: &#104;&#101;&#108;&#108;&#111;&#64;&#114;&#97;&#119;&#103;&#114;&#97;&#112;&#104;&#115;&#46;&#105;&#111;.\nThe \"obvius fix\" RULE\nInspired by CARTO \"obvious fix\" rule we decided to integrate that rule also into our contribution policy.\nRAWGraphs's contribution policy is aimed at encouraging broad participation from our community and minimizing risks to the project owners and our community due to inappropriate contributions of the intellectual property of others.\nAs a general standard, RAWGraphs requires every contributor to fill out a Contributor License Agreement (\u201cCLA\u201d), either individually or on behalf of a corporate entity.\nHOWEVER, very small contributions (such as fixing spelling errors), where the content change is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a CLA.\nHow does the obvious fix rule work?\nAny committer may commit fixes without first signing a CLA for obvious typos, grammar mistakes, and formatting problems wherever they may be.\nWhenever you invoke the Obvious Fix Rule, please say so in your commit message. For example:\ncommit fed5f73b831906878a32bddaee98dcc5652f1716\nAuthor: giovanna &lt;giovanna@rawgraphs.io&gt;\nDate: Mon Feb 06 09:41:00 2017 +0100\nFix typo in README.\nObvious fix.\nWhat qualifies as an obvious fix?\nAn obvious fix is a pull request that does not contain creative work. We rely on your judgment to determine what is \u201cobvious\u201d; if you\u2019re not sure, just ask by sending an email to: hello@rawgraphs.io\nAs a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:\n\nSpelling/grammar fixes;\nCorrecting typos;\nCleaning up comments in the code;\nChanges to white space or formatting;\nBug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants, literals, or simple variable types;\nAdding logging messages or debugging output;\nChanges to \u2018metadata\u2019 files like Gemfile, rebar.config, Makefile, app.config, sys.config, .gitignore, example configuration files, build scripts, etc.;\nChanges that reflect outside facts, like renaming a build directory or changing a constant;\nChanges in build or installation scripts;\nRe-ordering of objects or subroutines within a source file (such as alphabetizing routines);\nMoving source files from one directory or package to another, with no changes in code;\nBreaking a source file into multiple source files, or consolidating multiple source files into one source file, with no change in code behavior;\nChanges to words or phrases isolated from their context;\nChanges to typeface.", "confidence": [1.0], "technique": "File Exploration"}, "releases": {"excerpt": [{"tagName":

Supported files: plain texts (CSV, TSV) and Microsoft Excel files (XLSX), JSON files.\n- Load data from URL (VERY experimental, only for websites with cross-origin resource sharing enabled, [see here](http://enable-cors.org/))\n- Parse JSON files (both by copy and paste or by drag and drop), load arrays of objects as tables.\n- Stack/unstack your data! If you have the dataset as a matrix, you can easily convert it in a dataset within the RAW interface. [See here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data) for more information about stacked/unstacked (or wide/narrow) data.\n\n### Data samples\n- More data samples, one example per graph type.\n\n### Visual models\n- Added chart categories: charts are now grouped by type (e.g. hierarchies, dispersions, time series\u2026)\n- Added new visual models: Sunburst, Bump Charts, Horizon Charts, Box Plot, Pie Charts, Bar Charts.\n- Improved existing models, adding new options and addressing suggestions provided by users.\n\n### Visualization\n- When a field is mandatory (e.g. hierarchy in treemap), instead of displaying the visualization, the list of the required fields will appear.\n\n### License\n- We changed the license to Apache 2.0. The project remains open-source, and the new licence allows you to reuse the code with any other kind of license.\n", "tarballUrl": "https://api.github.com/repos/rawgraphs/rawgraphs-app/tarball/v1.2.0", "zipballUrl": "https://api.github.com/repos/rawgraphs/rawgraphs-app/zipball/v1.2.0", "htmlUrl": "https://github.com/rawgraphs/rawgraphs-app/releases/tag/v1.2.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rawgraphs/rawgraphs-app/releases/5172841", "dateCreated": "2017-01-16T16:52:42Z", "datePublished": "2017-01-16T17:11:51Z"}, {"tagName": "1.0.2", "name": "1.0.2 Bump Charts and bug fixes", "authorName": "giorgiocaviglia", "authorType": "User", "body": "- Added Bump Charts\n- Fixed several bugs\n- Using native canvas conversion instead of canvg\n- Using Date instead of moment (improved performances)\n- Updated CodeMirror (4.5)\n", "tarballUrl": "https://api.github.com/repos/rawgraphs/rawgraphs-app/tarball/1.0.2", "zipballUrl": "https://api.github.com/repos/rawgraphs/rawgraphs-app/zipball/1.0.2", "htmlUrl": "https://github.com/rawgraphs/rawgraphs-app/releases/tag/1.0.2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rawgraphs/rawgraphs-app/releases/534265", "dateCreated": "2014-09-04T01:50:56Z", "datePublished": "2014-09-04T03:02:30Z"}, {"tagName": "1.0.1", "name": "1.0.1", "authorName": "giorgiocaviglia", "authorType": "User", "body": "- Added Small Multiples chart\n- Minor CSS fixes\n- Dates parsing improved for Scatterplot, Hexagonal Binning and Streamgraph\n", "tarballUrl": "https://api.github.com/repos/rawgraphs/rawgraphs-app/tarball/1.0.1", "zipballUrl": "https://api.github.com/repos/rawgraphs/rawgraphs-app/zipball/1.0.1", "htmlUrl": "https://github.com/rawgraphs/rawgraphs-app/releases/tag/1.0.1", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rawgraphs/rawgraphs-app/releases/357601", "dateCreated": "2014-06-04T22:31:08Z", "datePublished": "2014-06-04T22:32:19Z"}, {"tagName": "1.0", "name": "1.0", "authorName": "giorgiocaviglia", "authorType": "User", "body": "", "tarballUrl": "https://api.github.com/repos/rawgraphs/rawgraphs-app/tarball/1.0", "zipballUrl": "https://api.github.com/repos/rawgraphs/rawgraphs-app/zipball/1.0", "htmlUrl": "https://github.com/rawgraphs/rawgraphs-app/releases/tag/1.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rawgraphs/rawgraphs-app/releases/264694", "dateCreated": "2014-04-09T18:11:13Z", "datePublished": "2014-04-09T19:39:26Z"}], "confidence": [1.0], "technique": "GitHub API"}}

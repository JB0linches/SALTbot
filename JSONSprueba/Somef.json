We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project. Your help is essential for keeping it great.\nPlease note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.\nSubmitting a pull request\n\nFork and clone the repository\nConfigure and install the dependencies: npm install\nMake sure the tests pass on your machine: npm test, note: these tests also run the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to check for type errors, so there's no need to run these commands separately.\nCreate a new branch: git checkout -b my-branch-name\nMake your change, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass\nPush to your fork and submit a pull request\nPat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.\n\nHere are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:\n\nFollow the style guide which is using Prettier. Any linting errors should be shown when running npm test\nWrite and update tests.\nKeep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.\nWrite a good commit message.\n\nWork in Progress pull requests are also welcome to get feedback early on, or if there is something that blocked you.\nTo submit a pull request for a previous version of Probot, checkout the maintenance branch before creating a new branch, e.g. git checkout 7.x &amp;&amp; git checkout -b my-branch-name. When submitting the pull request, set the base branch to the same maintenance branch.\nMerging the Pull Request & releasing a new version\nReleases are automated using semantic-release.\nThe following three commit message conventions determine which version is released:\n\nfix: ... or fix(scope name): ... prefix in subject: bumps fix version, e.g. 1.2.3 \u2192 1.2.4\nfeat: ... or feat(scope name): ... prefix in subject: bumps feature version, e.g. 1.2.3 \u2192 1.3.0\nBREAKING CHANGE: in body: bumps breaking version, e.g. 1.2.3 \u2192 2.0.0\n\nOnly one version number is bumped at a time, the highest version change trumps the others. Besides publishing a new version to npm, semantic-release also creates a git tag and release on GitHub, generates changelogs from the commit messages and puts them into the release notes.\nNew versions are released from the following branches\n\nmaster: new versions are published to npm using the @latest dist-tag\nnext: new versions are published to npm using the @next dist-tag. When merging the next branch into master, the @latest dist-tag will be bumped automatically.\nbeta: a new @beta version will be released. For example, if the current version is 7.5.0, then the first version will be published as 8.0.0-beta using the @beta dist-tag. The next version will be 8.0.0-beta.1, etc. When merged into master, the 8.0.0 version will be released automatically and all release notes will be combined into the 8.0.0 release. See also Publishing pre-releases.\n&lt;version&gt;.x: For example 7.x. New bug fix & feature releases are published the given version. No breaking changes are allowed. See also Publishing maintenance releases.\n\nWhen in doubt, ping @gr2m.\nJust starting out?
